Vim syntax highlighting for KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)

This is inspired by Nils Liberg's fantastic [SublimeKSP plugin](http://nilsliberg.se/ksp/). This only provides syntax 
highlighting for now but I hope to incorporate Nils' KSP compiler eventually.

## Installation
Using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git):
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/nojanath/vim-ksp.git
```

## Usage
After installation, open any file with a .ksp extension and Vim will detect the filetype as KSP. It highlights KSP
keywords, built-in variables and commands, etc.  Easy peasy.
